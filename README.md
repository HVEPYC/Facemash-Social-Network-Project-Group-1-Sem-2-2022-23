<u>WIA1002 Data Structures Project Title: Facemash</u>
=======================================================

Created by Group 1, OCC 10 of WIA1002 Data Structures, Semester 2, Year 2022/23

This Repository contains all the Source Files for our Project, which is a result of almost 2 months worth of Development Work.

This Project, titled "Facemash", is a project which features a fully working social networking system, complete with a GUI built in Python.

It features a sample database of people, along with the ability to sign up for a new account, make changes to account details, and much more.

It also features a completely functional friend system, along with friend requests, and a system to set relationship statuses with support to display partner information.

The backend uses a combination of Java and MySQL, and the Java backend has complete control over the Python GUI and the MySQL database as well.

Installation Steps can be found in the "Instructions to Run the Program.txt" file.

Thank You.
Group 1.
